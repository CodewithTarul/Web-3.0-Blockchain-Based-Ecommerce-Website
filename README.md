# Web 3.0 Blockchain-Based E-commerce Website

## Introduction
In recent years, cybersecurity breaches have increasingly targeted e-commerce platforms, with over 570 stores in 55 countries compromised and over $7 million generated from stolen payment cards. This alarming trend underscores the urgent need for enhanced security measures. Our Web 3.0 Blockchain-Based E-commerce Website aims to address these issues by integrating blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient online shopping experience.

## Literature Review
We evaluated existing literature on blockchain technology in e-commerce and identified several drawbacks:
1. **E-commerce Payment Model Using Blockchain** by Shee-Lhn Kim & Seung-Hee Kim highlights the need for integrating blockchain features to ensure secure transactions without additional modules.
2. **Blockchain Technology in E-commerce Platform** by Qusay Al Maatouk & Maen Alrshdan emphasizes the challenges of modifying blockchain data and its critical role in maintaining data confidentiality and security.
3. **Emerging Blockchain-Based Applications and Techniques** by Yinsheng Li discusses the high implementation costs of blockchain, despite its secure infrastructure.
4. **Decentralized Finance Research and Developments** by Peterson K. Ozilil addresses execution risks in smart contracts and the potential for vulnerabilities due to coding errors.
